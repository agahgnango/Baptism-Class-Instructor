Welcome to the Baptism Class Curriculum! A four-week discipleship path built solely on the teachings of Jesus, not tradition, not denominational culture, and not inherited doctrine.
This curriculum is designed to help instructors guide participants into authentic new-birth faith, rooted in the Kingdom message Christ Himself preached.

## Why this curriculum matters

Many baptism classes focus on rituals. But **Jesus focused on transformation**. so this curriculum returns to:
- **The Gospel Jesus preached** : The good news of the Kingdom.
- **The new birth He required** : Not simply water, but Spirit-empowered life.
- **The sanctified lifestyle He modeled and taught** : Holiness without legalism.
- **The identity He gives** : Sons and daughters walking in divine purpose.

## What Instructors will find inside

Each of the 4 sessions includes:
- **Clear biblical foundations** directly from Jesus’ words.
- **Discussion prompts** that provoke repentance, faith, and obedience.
- **Practical life applications** for discipleship and spiritual growth.
- **Instructor notes** for clarity, depth, and teaching confidence.

## The Goal

Not simply baptizing people…
But leading them to become **new creations**, filled with the Holy Spirit, and rooted in the Kingdom life Jesus inaugurated.
