### Part 1 — God as Revealed by Jesus

#### THE OLD TESTAMENT SHADOW
In the Old Testament, we can immediately see that GOD reveals Himself progressively—through shadows that point toward a greater revelation to come. 

**God walking with humanity (Genesis 2–3)**

In Genesis, especially chapters 2 and 3, we observe God walking with humanity. This interaction happened before the fall, highlighting God’s original intent for relationship. 

>And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. (Genesis 3:8 AMPC)

But then, after sin entered, humanity hides—not God.

**God reveals His name to Moses (Exodus 3)**

In Exodus 3:14, we can also see GOD seeking relationship, **not ritual**
> And God said to Moses, I Am Who I Am and What I Am, and I Will Be What I Will Be; and He said, You shall say this to the Israelites: I Am has sent me to you! (Exodus 3:14 AMPC)

**God is like a Shepherd, Father-like, tender (Psalm 23; Psalm 103)**

In Psalm 23; Psalm 103, We can see GOD who guides, protects, and has fatherly compassion

> 1 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 3 he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. 4 Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. (Psalm 23:1–4 NIV)

> As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him; (Psalm 103:13)

**God is holy, compassionate, and righteous (Exodus 34)**

In Exodus 34:6–7 we can see a GOD full of Compassion + holiness held together

> 6 And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.” (Exodus 34:6–7 NIV)

**God promises a New Covenant, a New Heart, and His Spirit**

In Jeremiah 31 and Ezekiel 36, we can see that GOD was going to, one day, restore relationship fully, from the inside out.

> 31 “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.
> 32 It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to[a] them,” declares the Lord.
> 33 “This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord. “I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.

#### THE NEW TESTAMENT FULFILLMENT — JESUS MAKES GOD FULLY KNOWN

And then Jesus appears — and claims what no prophet ever dared: He is the full revelation of the God of the Old Testament. And how do we know that?

**Jesus reveals God as FATHER (John 14)**

In John 14, The invisible God becomes visible in Jesus. which is a Fullfilment on its own. Because if anyone was still unclear about what GOD looks like, Jesus is making it clear.

> Whoever has seen Me has seen the Father. (John 14:9)

**Jesus shows the Father’s heart in the Prodigal Son (Luke 15)**

In Luke 15:20, we can see GOD who RUNS toward sinners.

> So he got up and went to his father. “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; **he ran to his son**, threw his arms around him and kissed him.

**God is GOOD and ONLY GOOD (Acts 10:38)**

in Acts 10:38, Jesus demonstrates God's goodness everywhere He goes.

>  how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.

**God is COMPASSIONATE (Matthew 9:36)**

In Matthew 9:36, The compassion of the Psalms becomes flesh. 
if you remember, throughout the Old Testament, God reveals Himself as deeply moved by the suffering of His people—not distant, not indifferent (Psalm 103:13, Psalm 145:8–9, Isaiah 40:11).

> 36 **When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them**, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

**God is JUST and HOLY (Matthew 23:23; John 8:11)**

In Matthew 23:23 and John 8:11, we can see that Holiness + mercy meet perfectly in Christ.

> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.(Matthew 23:23 NIV)

> “No one, sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.” (John 8:11 NIV)

**God desires RELATIONSHIP, not religion (John 4:23–24)**

In John 4:23–24, we can clearly see that GOD is not after rituals; He is after hearts.

> 23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. 24 God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”

**Eternal life = KNOWING the Father (John 17:3)**

In John 17:3, we finally understand that Eternal life is not a place, **it's a relationship.**

> 3 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
