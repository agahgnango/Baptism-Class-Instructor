### Part 2 — Why Jesus Came

#### THE OLD TESTAMENT SHADOW

In the Old Testament, We can see that GOD desires to be known — yet humanity could not bear the fullness of His glory

**Moses’ Request: “Show me Your glory”**

In Exodus 33:20, Moses longed to see God as He truly is. But God answered:

> 20 But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.” (Exodus 33:20 NIV)

Moses is allowed only a passing-by glory, a partial glimpse, a shadow of God’s true nature. What this scripture reveals is that **The human condition could not yet handle the full revelation of God**.

**The Prophets: A promise that the veil will one day be removed**

The Old Testament is filled with hints that God Himself would one day step into human history in a way people could see, hear, and touch.
In Isaiah 40:5, the prophet prophesied:

> 5 And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,
> and all people will see it together.
> For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” (Isaiah 40:5 NIV)

This was a future hope — a day when God’s glory would no longer be hidden, His nature would no longer be shadowed, Humanity would behold God without dying.

**The Old Testament Saints: Living with glimpses, not fullness**

- Abraham heard His voice.
- Jacob wrestled a mysterious Man.
- Moses saw God’s back.
- Isaiah saw Him high and lifted up.
- Ezekiel saw a brilliant, fiery vision.

Yes, These were all real encounters, but yet still:

- Partial
- Symbolic
- Shadowed
- Filtered through clouds, fire, angels, visions, and veils

The Old Testament experience is summarized this way: **They saw hints, glimpses, and reflections but not the fullness of who God is.**

**You are probably asking yourself, why this shadow?**

Because the fullness of God could not be revealed until:
- Sin was dealt with
- The separation was removed
- God could meet humanity face-to-face without destroying them
It is as if in the Old Testament, GOD creates a holy longing, a longing that cries out:
> **“When will God reveal Himself completely?”**

#### THE NEW TESTAMENT FULFILLMENT — JESUS REVEALS THE FATGHER COMPLETELY

The Old Testament longed for a day when God would no longer be hidden behind clouds, veils, fire, and symbols. **That longing is fulfilled in Jesus.**

**Jesus makes a claim no prophet ever dared to make**

in the Old Testament, Prophets used to say:
- “Thus says the LORD…”
- “The word of the LORD came to me…”
- “I saw a vision…”

But Jesus says something categorically different. in John 14,9:

> 9 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? **Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father**. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?

No prophet ever claimed that. No angel ever said that. No patriarch would dare speak that way.
Jesus is not saying He resembles the Father. He is saying:

> I AM the visible revelation of the invisible God.(John 14:9 NIV)

**John interprets this reality for us**

This is how John, the apostle closest to Jesus’ heart, interprets this reality for us
> 18 **No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son**, who is himself God and[a] is in closest relationship with the Father, **has made him known**. (John 1:18 NIV)

The phrase **“made Him known”** means:
- to fully reveal
- to explain perfectly
- to narrate or unfold completely

In other words: **Jesus is the Father explained in human form.**

**Jesus did not come just to teach about God — He came to SHOW God**

Many teachers bring information. Prophets bring messages.**But Jesus brings manifestation.**
He shows the Father by:
- speaking like the Father
- loving like the Father
- healing like the Father
- forgiving like the Father
- judging like the Father
- weeping with the broken
- embracing sinners
- confronting hypocrisy
- restoring the outcast

Every word, every miracle, every tear, every touch is **the Father expressed in human language**.

**Jesus is the exact imprint, not an approximation**

Scripture reinforces this repeatedly:
- **Colossians 1:15** >  “He is the image of the invisible God.”
- **Hebrews 1:3** >  “He is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact imprint of His nature.”
- **John 1:14** > “We have seen His glory… full of grace and truth.”

This means:
- Jesus **is not a messenger about God**.
- Jesus **is God revealing God**.
- Jesus **is the fullness Moses could not see**.
- Jesus **is the glory Isaiah prophesied would be revealed**.

**What this means for us**

When you look at Jesus:

- You are seeing the Father’s heart.
- You are hearing the Father’s voice.
- You are witnessing the Father’s compassion.
- You are encountering the Father’s holiness.
- You are experiencing the Father’s love.

There is **no difference** between the heart of Jesus and the heart of the Father.
Jesus is not the “nicer version” of God. **He is the perfect revelation of God.**

**Part-One Recap**

Jesus **is God made visible**.
Jesus **is the Father revealed**.
Jesus **is the glory the prophets longed to see**.
