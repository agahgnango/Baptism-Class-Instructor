### Part 2 — Why Jesus Came

#### THE OLD TESTAMENT SHADOW

In the Old Testament, We can see that GOD desires to be known — yet humanity could not bear the fullness of His glory

**Moses’ Request: “Show me Your glory”**

In Exodus 33:20, Moses longed to see God as He truly is. But God answered:

> 20 But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.” (Exodus 33:20 NIV)

Moses is allowed only a passing-by glory, a partial glimpse, a shadow of God’s true nature. What this scripture reveals is that **The human condition could not yet handle the full revelation of God**.

**The Prophets: A promise that the veil will one day be removed**

The Old Testament is filled with hints that God Himself would one day step into human history in a way people could see, hear, and touch.
In Isaiah 40:5, the prophet prophesied:

> 5 And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,
> and all people will see it together.
> For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” (Isaiah 40:5 NIV)

This was a future hope — a day when God’s glory would no longer be hidden, His nature would no longer be shadowed, Humanity would behold God without dying.

**The Old Testament Saints: Living with glimpses, not fullness**

- Abraham heard His voice.
- Jacob wrestled a mysterious Man.
- Moses saw God’s back.
- Isaiah saw Him high and lifted up.
- Ezekiel saw a brilliant, fiery vision.

Yes, These were all real encounters, but yet still:

- Partial
- Symbolic
- Shadowed
- Filtered through clouds, fire, angels, visions, and veils

The Old Testament experience is summarized this way: **They saw hints, glimpses, and reflections but not the fullness of who God is.
**

**You are probably asking yourself, why this shadow?**

Because the fullness of God could not be revealed until:
- Sin was dealt with
- The separation was removed
- God could meet humanity face-to-face without destroying them
It is as if in the Old Testament, GOD creates a holy longing, a longing that cries out:
> **“When will God reveal Himself completely?”**

#### THE NEW TESTAMENT FULFILLMENT — JESUS MAKES GOD FULLY KNOWN

And then Jesus appears — and claims what no prophet ever dared: He is the full revelation of the God of the Old Testament. And how do we know that?

**Jesus reveals God as FATHER (John 14)**

In John 14, The invisible God becomes visible in Jesus. which is a Fullfilment on its own. Because if anyone was still unclear about what GOD looks like, Jesus is making it clear.

> Whoever has seen Me has seen the Father. (John 14:9)

**Jesus shows the Father’s heart in the Prodigal Son (Luke 15)**

In Luke 15:20, we can see GOD who RUNS toward sinners.

> So he got up and went to his father. “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; **he ran to his son**, threw his arms around him and kissed him.

**God is GOOD and ONLY GOOD (Acts 10:38)**

in Acts 10:38, Jesus demonstrates God's goodness everywhere He goes.

>  how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.

**God is COMPASSIONATE (Matthew 9:36)**

In Matthew 9:36, The compassion of the Psalms becomes flesh. 
if you remember, throughout the Old Testament, God reveals Himself as deeply moved by the suffering of His people—not distant, not indifferent (Psalm 103:13, Psalm 145:8–9, Isaiah 40:11).

> 36 **When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them**, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

**God is JUST and HOLY (Matthew 23:23; John 8:11)**

In Matthew 23:23 and John 8:11, we can see that Holiness + mercy meet perfectly in Christ.

> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.(Matthew 23:23 NIV)

> “No one, sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.” (John 8:11 NIV)

**God desires RELATIONSHIP, not religion (John 4:23–24)**

In John 4:23–24, we can clearly see that GOD is not after rituals; He is after hearts.

> 23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. 24 God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”

**Eternal life = KNOWING the Father (John 17:3)**

In John 17:3, we finally understand that Eternal life is not a place, **it's a relationship.**

> 3 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.

Part-One Recap

In Jesus, all the shadows become **substance**.
The distant GOD becomes **Abba Father**.
The holy GOD becomes **accessible**.
The compassionate GOD becomes **touchable**.
The relational GOD becomes **Emmanuel : “GOD with us.”**

This is the GOD you are going to be baptized into:
**The Father revealed through the Son, embraced by the Spirit.**
