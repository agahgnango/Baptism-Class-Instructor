## Session 1 - Meeting the TRUE God revealed by Jesus

**Goal:** Remove false ideas; see the Father clearly. 

**Important note :** Understanding Jesus through the shadows and the substance

Before we begin Session 1, it is very important to understand why this baptism curriculum will use both the Old Testament (OT) and the New Testament (NT).
Many believers focus only on the NT when studying Jesus, but Jesus Himself teaches us that the OT is the foundation of His message.

Jesus did not ignore the Old Testament, **He fulfilled it**.

Throughout His ministry, Jesus constantly referred to the OT:
- ```It is written…``` (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10) 
- ```The Scriptures testify about Me.``` (John 5:39)
- ```Everything written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.``` (Luke 24:44)

These passages are not small statements. They reveal something essential:

- **The entire Old Testament points forward to Jesus**.
- **Jesus is the completion, fulfillment, and full revelation of what the OT foreshadowed**.
- **The OT is full of** images, patterns, ceremonies, promises, and **events that serve as shadows pointing to a greater reality**, the reality **found in Christ**.

So in this curriculum, when we talk about:

- the nature of God,
- the new birth,
- repentance,
- baptism,
- the Holy Spirit,
- and the Kingdom,
we will look first at the Old Testament shadow, and then at the New Testament fulfillment.

This approach will help you see:

- the unity of Scripture,
- the continuity of God’s plan,
- and the depth of what God has done for us in Christ.
Most importantly, it will help you understand why **baptism is not just a Christian ritual**, but **the fulfillment of God’s ancient covenant plan** revealed across Scripture.

**So, welcome to Session 1  — where we will begin with the God who was revealed in shadows in the Old Testament, and fully revealed in the face of Jesus Christ.**
