### Part 1 — God as Revealed by Jesus
In the Old Testament, we can immediately see that GOD reveals Himself progressively—through shadows that point toward a greater revelation to come. 

Let us take the look of genesis where we can see GOD walking with humanity in Chapter 2 and 3. Notice, this was before the fall.

>And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. (Genesis 3:8)
